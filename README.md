# bloc-jams-jquery
A jQuery-driven music player app created during my UX Design apprenticeship at Bloc. 

# The application should address the following acceptance criteria:

* I immediately see the album cover image and title, the artist's name, and some general release info.
* As a listener, I want to have a set of standard music controls so that I have complete control over my listening experience.
* Regardless of scroll position, I see a "player bar" with controls for Play/Pause, Previous Track, Next Track, Seek, and Volume.
* The Play/Pause button shows a "play" icon if no song is playing.
* The Play/Pause button shows a "pause" button if a song is playing.
* The Previous Track and Next Track buttons only respond when a song is playing.
* The Previous Track button plays the previous song on the album.
* The Previous Track button doesn't respond if there is no previous song.
* The Next Track button plays the next song on the album.
* The Next Track button doesn't respond if there is no next song.
* I see a slider that shows the current time position of the song.
* I can click and drag on the time control slider to change the current song position.
* I see a slider that shows the player's current volume.
* I can click and drag the volume slider to adjust the volume.
